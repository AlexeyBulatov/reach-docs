### Only Single solution in RTK mode

1) Check that rover has a connection to a base station and that it is receiving the corrections.

2) Make sure that the rover sees minimum 5 satellites with high SNR level (45-50).

3) Check that there are 5 common satellites between the rover and the base station with high SNR level (45-50).

### Only Float solution in RTK mode

1) Make sure that rover sees minimum 5 satellites with high SNR level (45-50).

2) There has to be at least 5 common satellites between the rover and the base station with high SNR level (45-50).

3) Check that baseline length (distance between the rover and the base station) is less than 10km.
