#### 3D model

This 3D model can be used as a reference for case design. Please note that Reach comes in protective heatshrink that increases its outer dimensions slightly.

During case design keep in mind that you should not place anything close to the Wi-Fi antenna or performance might be degraded. Try to leave at least 5mm of distance to the closest object.
