### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How accurate the coordinates of Reach RTK are?

If you have a base station with known coordinates and a good antenna, you can
expect accuracy horizontal down to 1-2cm and vertical down accuracy to 2-4cm.

#### Will I always get cm coordinates?

No RTK receiver will provide fixed solution all the time. RTK technology has
some requirements to work properly such as good GPS reception, high quality
antenna and low EMI. Bad weather conditions might also degrade solution quality.

#### Why is it so cheap compared to Topcon, Novatel, Javad, Trimble, etc.?   

These companies are making industrial equipment and use custom components which
leads to a corresponding price level. We rely on off-the-shelf electronic
components and open-source software. This lets us to keep the reasonable price.

#### What is the maximum baseline (range between receivers)?

Recommended maximum baseline is 10km.

#### Why coordinates sometimes do not match Google Maps, Bing Maps, Apple Maps?

The positions in Google Maps and other map services donâ€™t necessarily coincide
with the correct positions on Earth. In different areas the offset may be up to
tens of meters.

#### What is the output format?

Solution can be output or logged in a common NMEA format as well as in simple
text LLH (Lattitude-Longitude-Height) format.
Raw data logging is done in UBX and Rinex.
