### Antenna placement

You can place your smartphone near the window in your house and it will obtain GPS coordinates after some time, but for RTK such environment won't be sufficient. For RTK to work there are special requirements for antenna placement that are much more strict that for a standalone GPS.

##### No obstacles blocking the skyview

Antenna needs to have a clear skyview 30 degrees above the horizon. There should be no obstacles that could block the view like: buildings, trees, cars, humans, laptops etc.

Examples of bad environments for antenna placement: indoors, urban areas, forest.

Examples of **good** environments for antenna placement: field, top of the hill, rooftop of the building.

##### No electronics nearby

Electronic devices may produce RF noise that could affect reception of the GPS signal. Keep all electronics (including the Reach itself) as far as possible from the antenna.

##### Ground plane

Always place an antenna on a ground plane, it helps to reduce the noise. Ground plane is a piece of metal (copper and aluminum are known to be good) bigger than 70x70mm. It may be a separate piece of metal or a roof of a car or a metal roof of the building.
