#### Output: logs and solution

Reach supports outputting two types of data: **raw data logs** and processed **solution**.

**Raw data logs** contain all the messages sent by base and rover receivers. These logs can be used later for post-processing. On the contrary, **solution** is a stream of already processed and enhanced coordinates. Available solution formats include llh, xyz, nmea and enu.

By default, all **raw data logs** are saved as files on the device and are available for download on ReachView's **Logs** tabs.

*TODO*
Logs can be used for post-processing.
