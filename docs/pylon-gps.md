**INTEGRATION OF REACH WITH PYLON GPS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Pylon GPS is a correction sharing project developed by Charles West .

Pylon GPS makes it easy to share GPS corrections from your basestation and allows mobile units to get corrections from any nearby basestations. This means that when a Pylon GPS basestation is deployed, everyone within 10 km of the basestation can get updates and create applications using differential GPS.

More information about Pylon GPS is available at [PylonGPS official website](http://pylongps.com/).
